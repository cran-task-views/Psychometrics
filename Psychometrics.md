Psychometrics is concerned with theory and techniques of psychological
measurement. Psychometricians have also worked collaboratively with
those in the field of statistics and quantitative methods to develop
improved ways to organize, analyze, and scale corresponding data. Since
much functionality is already contained in base R and there is
considerable overlap between tools for psychometry and tools described
in other views, we only give a brief overview of packages that are closely related to
psychometric methodology.

Contributions are always welcome and encouraged, either via e-mail to the
maintainer or by submitting an issue or pull request in the GitHub
repository linked above.


### Item Response Theory (IRT):

    extended Rasch models, i.e. the ordinary Rasch model for dichotomous
    data (RM), the linear logistic test model (LLTM), the rating scale
    model (RSM) and its linear extension (LRSM), the partial credit
    model (PCM) and its linear extension (LPCM) using conditional ML
    estimation. Missing values are allowed.

    the simple RM. Additionally, functions for estimating Birnbaum's 2-
    and 3-parameter models based on a marginal ML approach are

    data, and the linear multidimensional logistic model.

    dichotomous and polytomous response data using unidimensional and
    multidimensional latent trait models under the IRT paradigm.
